# 04 – Express Server with Logging and Routing

This project recreates the same behavior as the custom HTTP server, but this time using **Express.js**, a popular Node.js framework that makes routing, response handling, and middleware much easier.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to set up a basic **Express.js** server.
- How to handle **GET** and **POST** routes using `app.get()` and `app.post()`.
- How to use **middleware** for logging requests into a file.
- How Express automatically sets headers and ends responses for you.
- How Express simplifies routing compared to the raw Node.js `http` module.
